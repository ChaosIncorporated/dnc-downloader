# DNC Email Downloader
A simple script that downloads all the DNC emails from Wikileaks into their original format, so they can be 
loaded into an email client for further perusal.

### How to run
* Just execute the script on any modern/semi-modern Linux system.
* I'd imagine that Cygwin would work too, 
but I haven't tested it.
